# 4.3 Reflection Questions

> Be sure to provide screenshots along with your explanations.

### 1. There are multiple methods for developing software and many are similar to Design Thinking. How would you map the steps in Design Thinking onto the following phrases commonly used when developing a software program?
#### a. investigating
#### b. designing
#### c. prototyping
#### d. testing

[The empathize and define steps in design thinking is similar to the investigating step, both involving learning more to prepare to make the app, as well as figuring out what the app will be. Designing most easily maps to ideate, since both are about coming up with ideas and laying the plans. Prototyping maps to prototyping sicne both are about making models, and testing maps to testing since both are about testing.]

### 2. For each of the enhancements that you implemented: a) Describe the function of the enhancement. b) Give a brief description of the enhancement. c) Provide screenshots of important blocks and describe how you used them to solve certain programming problems.

[This enhancement adds a feature that keeps track of misses and adds them to the score. When the person misses the sprite, the app shows that they missed and takes a point of the score. I made it work by using the wehn canvas,touched block and adding an if statement that checks if any sprite was touched. The blocks then adds a point to the misses while taking off a point from the score, and then finally telsl the score to update using a different procedure. ]

### 3. Describe in general what the reset procedure does.

[The reset procedure resets both the scores and misses, as well as turning the timer back on, so that the entire program can run again.]

### 4. Describe how the reset procedure contributes to the overall functionality of the program.

[The reset procedure provides an easy way to start over from the begginning without having to constantly make sure that the score is 0 and the timer is on.]
