# 4.7 Reflection Questions

### 1. Consider the following Dilbert cartoon. Would it be possible for a PRNG to spit out 6 NINEs in a row?

[While it is technically possible for a PRNG to spit out 6 nines depending on the exact algorithm it is using, in practice it would basically never happen due to how randomness is simulated.]

### 2. Are slot machines fair? Why or why not?

[Slot machiens aren't fair because they are preset to always pay out less then the total of what is put in, and the outcome is completely random. This means that even if you play a thousand times, you would still not get back as much money as you put in, and you wouldn't have any better chance of winning. They also give back less moeny if you have to spend less on them, so they are even less fair.]

### 3. Is it possible to devise a method that would allow you to win consistently on a slot machine?

[It is not possibly because the outcome is always randomly generated as soon the lever is used, and the machiens are programmed to give back less money then they take in anyway.]
