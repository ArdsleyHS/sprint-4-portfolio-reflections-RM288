# 4.2 Reflection Questions

### 1. This app presents a new type of event which you haven't encountered before. What is that new event? How often is it triggered?

[This app presents the clock event, which is just an internal timer the phone keeps track of. It is triggered constantly and as often as needed, in this case it happens every one second.]

### 2. How do the procedures you wrote for this app help manage the complexity in your program code? Your response should be specific to the procedures you wrote, not procedures in general.

[The procedure that moves the light bulb around randomly is used to manage complexity by giving a very simple way to get the app to randomize the lightbulb location, without having to put in the blocks each time.]
