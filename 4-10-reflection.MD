# 4.10 Reflection Questions

## Explore Curricular Activities:

### 1. [Activity Part 1] Earlier in the course, you built the Map Tour app.
#### a. In the final version, what data, including data type, is collected from the user?

[The Map Tour app is collecting their location data, in the form of signals, as it is being used.]

#### b. Does the user know the data is being collected?

[The user may realize that this data is being collected since a map is shown, but it isn't explicitly stated so they may not realize. ]

#### c. Can they opt out of providing data and still use the app?

[If they opt out of providing this data they most likely will not be able to use this app because of how it is programmed.]

### 2. [Activity Part 2] How have social media platforms such as Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, etc. affected our privacy?

[Social media platforms have cost a lot of privacy. Social media platforms are places where people, often accidentally, reveal a lot of personal information about themselves, such as what they like, the general area where they live, etc. The platforms themselves also take a lot of information that they then sell to advertiser companies, further lowering privacy.]

### 3. [Activity Part 3] Is it possible to identify someone, perhaps a patient, knowing just the gender, birth date, and zip code? Why or why not?

[Depending the exact information, it entirely is possible to idenitfy someone with this information. The amount of peopel that will have that specific information all in conjugation is fairly low, so it wouldn't be too difficult to, if not identify, at least narrow down who someone might be with just this info.]

### 4. [Activity Part 4] Name the computing innovation you explored. Paste your paragraph from Activity Part 4 here.

[Phones take in a lot of data, like texting and browsing habits, what apps you like, where you spend your time, when you're using your phone, and more. Phones can get your sleeping patterns based on when you set the alarm clock and when you put the phone for charge, they can understand what your interests are based on the websites you visit, and so on. The phone can then take this image and give it to other companies to advertise to you. If the phone knows you spend a lot of time at school, it will conclude that youâ€™re a student and show ads for stuff like pencils or colleges. Phones can take data about changes in your sleeping pattern and use it to recommend new pillows or beds.
Phones also have a lot of security and data privacy concerns. Phones are always on you and contain an incredible amount of information about your daily life and who you are, so unauthorized access to that information can become a serious problem. People often store passwords on phones, or they may have personal text messages, emails, or pictures stored on phones. All of this data is very private and a breach of security could result in the spreading of this information, which makes it very important that phones are strict about security standards and about what information they give out.]
