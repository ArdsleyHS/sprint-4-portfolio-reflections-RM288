# 4.8 Reflection Questions

### 1. What are the main differences between Bill Nye's solar system model and the Second Life model?

[The main differences are that Bill Nye offers a much more visual and easily understable sense of scale, he really shows the how far the planets are from each other and the sun. The Second Life model, however, gives much more information about each planet, like rotation and orbitals, and it allows for the access of all this information at once.]

### 2. **(POGIL)** What would happen if there were lots more wolves than there are bunnies? Would the wolves live forever? Record your hypothesis, prediction and experiment results.

[The hypothesis was that the wolves will eat all the rabits and die quickly, while the predicition was that it would take around 30 iterations and leave behind only grass. The experiment itself showed that the rabits were quickly eaten, and the wolves also died off soon after. The experiment missed that all of the wolves would die almost instanteously after a certain amount of time had passed since the rabits went extinct.]

### 3. **(POGIL)** This model chose to include certain features and exclude other features. For example, this simulation only includes rabbits, wolves, and grass but there are other predators of rabbits and other food sources for rabbits. Why do you think the creators focused on these data elements and not others? How might this introduce bias (concentration on or interest in a particular area) into the simulation?

[I think the creators focused on just these data elements because it would allow them to be more accurate with the programming, and it would allow the program to both be more generally usefull and be more understandable at a glance. This introduced bias since it meant that rabits had almost no environmental pressures aside from just themselves and being eaten, which wouldn't be the case in the real world. The model also disfavoured the wolves since in real life they would have other sources of food and wouldn't go extinct so quickly after losing rabits. The model also doesn't take into account age and death that way, which makes it favour rabits since they reproduce fast]

### 4. A city's fire department is using simulation software to analyze how a fire in an apartment complex might spread under a number of conditions. Consider the benefits and limitations of using a simulation instead of studying the real thing.

#### a. Name at least one benefit of using simulation for this purpose.

[One benefit is that the simulation allows the fire department to have better plans in place for how to tackle different kinds of situations without having to waste resources or risk injury.]

#### b. Name at least one limitation of using simulation for this purpose.

[The simulation wouldn't be able to capture all of the nuances of the situations and would it would become increasingly difficult to add any more variables to the simulations since the interactions between all of them will have to be mapped out.]

### 5. Pick a model you use in your everyday life. What details does it capture and what details does it omit?

[A model I use in everyday life is the map of the town. It omits details like specific tree locations, or sidewalk placement, but what does it contain is very useful general information on where places are and the fastest way to get there. The map also doesn't capture tiny details like individual cars, but it can capture big details like clusters that cause traffic.]
