# 3.4 Reflection Questions

### 1. For enhancement \#5 (the if block exercise) give a brief description of your solution to this problem. **Provide a screenshot of your code** -- the revised blocks -- and describe how the if/else block works to solve the problem in this case. If appropriate, include a description of any significant problems or bugs you encountered in solving this problem.  App Inventor now has a Download Blocks as Image feature (right click on the white space in the blocks editor to choose) that also can be used to take a screenshot of all of your code or the Windows snipping tool can be used.

What do you think could be done to prevent the picture from disappearing when the app is restarted?
