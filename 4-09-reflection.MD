# 4.9 Reflection Questions

### 1. Which generation of the 4-bit simulators above is the most abstract? Why?

[Generation 2 is the most abstract because it uses an assembly language that stands in for commands that are fed into the computer, instead of the commands themselves, since the language is easier to understand and remember.]

### 2. Explain the purpose or function of the RAM and the CPU.

[The RAM serves as a temporary storage for the data values and instructions that CPU needs to perform its tasks, while the CPU decodes instructions and executes the program using information taken from the RAM.]

### 3. Describe in your own words the difference between the fetch and execute steps.

[The fetch step is where the instructions are recieved and decoded into machine language, while the execute step is where the data needed to follow the instruction is gather ebfore the commands themselves are carried out.]

### 4. Summarize the differences between assembly language and machine language programming.

[Assembly language programming uses key words and phrases to represent the different functions of the computer, while machine language program doesn't use any letters or human words and instead requires the direct input of a series of bytes and bits that contain the instructions and data.]
