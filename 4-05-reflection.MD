### 2. We didn’t need it for the loop in this lesson, but the *number element* in the *For each number* loop is a local variable whose value changes automatically on each iteration of the loop. For example, in this loop number would start at 1 and then go to 2, 3 and 4. And this value can be used in the body of the loop, as shown in this example. Given that, trace through this loop and figure out what value global *sum* would have when the loop finishes.
